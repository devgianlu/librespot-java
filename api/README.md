This module depends on `librespot-player` and, in addition, provides an API to interact with the Spotify client.

### Web API pass through
Use any endpoint from the [public Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/) by appending it to `/web-api/`, the request will be made to the API with the correct `Authorization` header and the result will be returned.
The method, body, and content type headers will pass through. Additionally, you can specify an `X-Spotify-Scope` header to override the requested scope, by default all will be requested.
